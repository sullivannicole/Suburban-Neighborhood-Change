# Suburban Neighborhood Change

## The Gist of the Project

The Suburban Neighborhood Change project is a [Metropolitan Council](https://metrocouncil.org) initiative to identify communities that are changing in similar ways, for similar reasons.  In connecting communities that are experiencing like patterns of transition, we hope to provide them with better resources and enhance our regional cohesion from the bottom-up.

## Who We Are

The Met Council is the [Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan planning organization (MPO)](https://metrocouncil.org/About-Us/The-Council-Who-We-Are.aspx), a federally-mandated agency that exists to serve the region with its long-range planning for transportation, economic development, environmental preservation, and more.

## Reproducing the Project

All libraries needed are imported in the import code chunk.  Note that it's possible to reproduce creation of the ACS 'percent new builds' variable from full ACS data using the commented out code chunk.
